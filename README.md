# GameTradr-Client

* A site where users can post public listings for games they want to trade.
* Users indicate what game they are looking to trade and what they will accept in
return.
* Users can make offers based on existing listings, and the owner of the listing
can choose to accept or decline their offer
  * Accepting an offer will cause all other offers on the same listing to be declined.
* Users can check on the status of their offers at any time by going to the offers
section of the site.
* Users can delete pending listings and offers. They cannot delete listings or
offers that have been completed.

The site uses the following services to interact with the API:
* Listing service
* Auth service
* Offer service
* Game service

In addition, the site uses an Auth guard to prevent users from accessing portions
of the site that require authentication.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0.

## Development Process

### What went well
The goal for this project was to challenge myself by using a third party api
as well as Angular 2. I enjoyed working with Angular and hope to use it again in
the future. I found that the components, services and guards in Angular 2 helped
with separation of concerns and to keep code more modular.

### What didn't go so well
-Scope: I bit off more than I could chew for this project. The UX from was very
complicated and required many different scenarios to be accounted for. As a result,
I did not complete all desired functionality. What was produced, however, is high
quality andf is functioning very well
-Keeping code DRY: In an effort to finish on time, I did not reuse code as I should
have and ended up repeating code.
